# Online-book-store-project-in-php


Our project is an application based project. We have made an online
library management system for users to read their favorite books.
We have used MySQL and notepad++ editor.
We will be using JavaScript language to take care of the front end and
sql for the backend development. We will be using many types of
constraints (for example no two user data can be same, passwords
cannot be the same as user name, etc) Our database will consist of 7
tables:
1.Admin
2.Purchase
3. tblauthors
4.tblbooks
5.tblcategory
6.tblissuedbookdetails
7. tblstudents 


In todayâ€™s world almost all the people need an online library from where they
can download or issue the books according to their preferences. At the same
time, they need a system which is more reliable with all the transactions. It is a
difficult task to provide all these features in one system. If such system is
made, it can be used in schools and libraries etc for managing their books and
users.
 An effort is made to cover such features in this system itself. Further changes
 can also be made as per the user needs and growing industrial needs. Hence,
 this system is designed as user friendly which is very easy to handle by the
 user.
 
 
 
 The main objective of this Online Library Management System Project is to
discipline the planning, organizing and managing the library tasks. Our project
aims at making the task of library easy. Library Management is entering the
records of new book and retrieving the details of book available in the library.
We can issue book to the library member and maintain their records and can
also checks how many book are issued and stock available in the library. In the
project we can maintain the late fine of library member who return the issued
book after the due date. This Library management system project is made in
HTML, php and uses My SQL Database(WAMPSTACK).

6. DATABASE AND SCHEMA
In our project we have used My SQL database. The name of our database is
libraray and it has 7 tables:
1.Admin
2.Purchase
3. tblauthors
4.tblbooks
5.tblcategory
6.tblissuedbookdetails
7. tblstudents
These tables consist of admin name, usernames, their id, details of books
like their category, ISBN numbers, status of students and the books
whether they are active or inactive, book price etc. In the purchase table
there are the details like price of the book, issue and return dates, card no
of the user which will be used for the payment etc. New entries can be
added or old entries can be modified or deleted using My SQL queries.
These tables have different types of keys like primary keys which are
unique for example ISBN number of every book is unique and similar is
the case with student and admin IDs. Other keys like foreign keys are also
there which are present in two or more tables for example ISBN number
will also act as a foreign key as it is present in 4 tables.
